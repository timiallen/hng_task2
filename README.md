## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before setting up and running the API, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js (at least version 16)
- MongoDB (either locally installed or a connection to a MongoDB Atlas cluster)
- Mongo Shell & MongoDB Compass

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Allenkayode/timi-Rest-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd Rest-api-hngx
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

## API Usage

### Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

- **Create a Person**: `POST /api`
- **Read All Persons**: `GET /api`
- **Read a Single Person**: `GET /api/_id` or `GET /api/name`
- **Update a Person**: `PUT /api/_id` or `PUT /api/name`
- **Delete a Person**: `DELETE /api/_id` or `DELETE /api/name`

Detailed documentation for each endpoint can be found [here](./Documentation.md).

### Authentication

Authentication is not required to access the API endpoints.

## Running the API locally

After running `npm install`, you might need to create a `.env file` and replace the connection string with yours because MongoDB atlas works with `IP` address in development mode.
After then follow the steps below:

1. Start the API server:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000/api`.

## Testing the API

You can navigate to the Test Script Folder to run the python script to test the CRUD operations.

Here is the **Hosted API:** `https://timi-rest-api.vercel.app/api`

You can use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [ThunderCLient] to test the API endpoints.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to the project.
